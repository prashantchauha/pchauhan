# Superconductor spectrum fitting
matlab fitting see-
%depending on required output the function names can be [recon,imgcon] or conduct or recon or imgcon
%Input variables are the frequency (THz), Temp (K), critical temp Tc (K)
% gap@zero_kelvin[d0](meV), elp = (epsilon_infinity -1) this contributes only to imaginary part.
To run the code just put a table or list of frequencies in THz , give correct temperature and estimated d0.
for fitting the imaginary part recon to imgcon in first line.
For using curvefit code please see the image
